<br><br>
In todayâ€™s world, we have to use different sites for posting blogs, posting quotes.
<br><br>We have another more sites to post different images of person and for connecting in social media.
<br><br>It is very important to stay updated, to stay connected to social media nowadays.
<br><br>So, it is very difficult to maintain different softwares and hardwares for blogs, quotes and images.
<br><br>It is a very tough job to handle these many more different databases.
<br><br>Blogs are the things which gives people knowledge, quotes are those who gives people motivation, uploading images in social media gives people a platform to showcase their and connect to different people.
<br><br>It is a waste of time to visit three different websites for these things.
